Project from the course Advanced Scientific Python Programming at UU
I have a piece of horrible code from a project, and I'm  going to clean it up
- rename variables, they're ridiculuosly long
- create functions instead of copying code the entire time
- also, I noticed some minor parts of the code not working probably, so as a bonus will fix that too
- restructure maybe
- improve documentation & readability
