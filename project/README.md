Project from the course Advanced Scientific Python Programming at UU
I have a piece of horrible code from a project, and I'm  going to clean it up
- rename variables, they're ridiculuosly long
- create functions instead of copying code the entire time
- minor parts not working properly, fixed
- restructure to more logical order
- improve documentation & readability
- figures look a little different since a calculation error was discovered in between the versions
